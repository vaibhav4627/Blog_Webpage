                        <p class="card-text">The Ministry of Labour and Employment, Govt. of India, under the Mission Mode Project implemented the National Career Service (NCS) Project for revamping public employment related services. For smooth transformation of these services, Model Career Centres (MCCs) have been set up to provide standardized employment services across the nation. In order to make these MCCs effectively functional, a ‘Young Professional Scheme’ was launched by Directorate General for Employment (DGE) with an aim to transform the emerging landscape of Employment Services and Career Counselling in India. For Effective functioning of Model Career Centres one Young Professional is being posted at each Model Career Centres located at various parts of the country.<br>
                            <br>
                            Keeping in view the existing staffing pattern at the Employment Exchanges (EEXs), it was felt that for operationalization of these Model Career Centres, professional manpower would be required to assist in carrying out NCS related activities and to infuse fresh perspective and professionalism in the working environment. Thus, a ‘Young Professional Scheme’ on the lines of erstwhile Planning Commission, was launched by Directorate General for Employment (DGE) with an aim to utilize the knowledge, energy and fresh way of thinking of these young social leaders to help better transform the emerging landscape of Employment Services and Career Counselling in India. As per the scheme one YP at each MCC and 6 at NICS Noida, 4 at DGE shall be deployed.<br>
